## Overview

WebSurf-AI is a full-stack application designed to bring the power of AI to your web browser. The backend is a FastAPI server that orchestrates the AI agent's actions, while the frontend is a Chrome extension that provides a seamless user interface.

The agent is capable of performing a wide range of tasks, from simple web navigation to complex data extraction and form submission. It uses a combination of computer vision and accessibility APIs to understand and interact with web pages, just like a human would.

## Tech Stack

-   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
-   **AI Orchestration:** Pydantic-AI
-   **Browser Automation:** Playwright
-   **Database:** SQLAlchemy (PostgreSQL recommended)
-   **Authentication:** JWT (OAuth2 password flow)
-   **Frontend:** Chrome Extension (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
-   **MCP Server:** Model Context Protocol server for browser automation

## Features

-   **Web Navigation:** Open, close, and navigate between tabs.
-   **Page Interaction:** Click buttons, links, and other elements.
-   **Scrolling:** Scroll up, down, left, or right.
-   **Form Filling:** Fill out text boxes, checkboxes, and other form fields.
-   **Screenshots:** Capture full-page or partial screenshots.
-   **Data Extraction:** Extract text and other data from web pages.
-   **File Embeddings:** Attach and process PDF and text files.
-   **RAG and Conversational AI:** Switch between Retrieval-Augmented Generation for factual queries and a conversational mode for more general chat.

## Quick Run (Development)

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.12+
-   Node.js & npm (optional - portable version auto-downloads if not present)
-   PostgreSQL (or adapt the database URL in your environment)

### 1. Backend

-   Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
-   Install dependencies from `pyproject.toml`:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
-   Copy the `example.env` file to `.env` and set your database and JWT secrets.
-   Run the FastAPI server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```

### 2. MCP Browser Server (Recommended)

The easiest way to run WebSurf-AI is using the automated launcher:

#### Windows

1. Navigate to the `websurf-build` directory
2. Run the launcher script:
   ```powershell
   .\launch.ps1
   ```
3. The script will:
   - Check for Node.js installation (uses system Node if available)
   - Download portable Node.js if not found (~30MB, one-time)
   - Install dependencies automatically
   - Download Chromium browser (~150MB, one-time)
   - Launch the browser with the extension pre-loaded
   - Create a desktop shortcut for future launches

#### Using the Shortcut

After the first run, you can launch WebSurf-AI by:
- Double-clicking the `WebSurf MCP.lnk` shortcut in the `websurf-build` directory
- The shortcut automatically applies the WebSurf icon if `websurf.ico` is present

#### Manual Method

Alternatively, you can run the MCP server manually:
```bash
cd websurf-mcp
node browser-mcp.js
```

This will launch the AI-powered browser with the extension loaded.

### 3. Frontend (Chrome Extension)

If you prefer to load the extension manually:

-   Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in your Chrome browser.
-   Enable "Developer mode".
-   Click "Load unpacked" and select the `chrome-extension` directory.
-   The WebSurf-AI icon will appear in your toolbar. Click it to open the sidebar and start using the agent.

**Note:** Sign up before logging in. All data stays on your local machine with OAuth2 protection for privacy.

## Distribution

### Creating a Portable Package

The launcher system creates a fully portable distribution that includes:
- Portable Node.js runtime (if system Node is not available)
- All dependencies auto-installed on first run
- Chromium browser downloaded automatically
- Desktop shortcut with custom icon
- No installation required for end users

To distribute WebSurf-AI:
1. Share the entire `websurf-build` and `websurf-mcp` directories
2. Users simply run `launch.ps1` (Windows) or use the created shortcut
3. Everything downloads and sets up automatically on first launch
